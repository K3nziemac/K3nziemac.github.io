            <p> I think Hugeinc is a good example of Visual Hierarchy because Throughout all of the website they have varying sizes of text or images to 
                help the viewer realize what the most important Thing on the page is.</p>

            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>

            <p> I think Bliss does a great job of the rule of thirds throughout their whole website.
                They'll often do pictures that take up half of the page and then have the type have a colored box that takes over 2/3 of the screen.
                By so doing helps the eye flow into the other side of the page without being chopped down the middle like most sites.They switch it up through the site to keep it visually interesting.

            <h3>Alignment</h3>

            <img
            class= "trailer"

            alt="homepage"
          />

            <p>I think Trailer Park is a wonderful example of alignment. Left-alignment on a web view but center alligned on a mobile view. Everything is so beautifully aligned
                so that it looks uniform . This principle works great for sites like this where they want everything to be clean and sleek and have their work speak for itself. </p>
